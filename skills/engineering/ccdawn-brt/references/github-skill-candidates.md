# GitHub Skill Candidates

Read this file only when BRT sees a specialized domain where a GitHub/community skill may outperform the current local fallback, or when the user asks to install/compare external skills.

## Routing rule

External candidates are install-gated:

- If the skill is installed in the current session, route to it.
- If it is not installed, use the local fallback and record the candidate as optional.
- Ask to install only when the fallback cannot produce the required output or the user explicitly wants the external skill.
- Do not route to a missing skill as the only owner.

## High ROI candidates found on GitHub

## Installation note

When the user asks to install one of these, prefer `skill-installer` or the source repo's install command. After installation, restart Codex or open a new thread before expecting auto-trigger metadata to appear.
